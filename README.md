## Hotel Business Insights Dashboard: Unveiling Performance and Trends
In my Business Intelligence project, I imported and organized raw data tables including information about hotels, rooms, aggregated bookings, and booking details. After cleaning the data and creating essential DAX measures and calculated columns, I designed a dashboard with user-friendly features. This dashboard allows users to filter data based on city and room class, with additional slicers for months, weeks, and years. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, revenue per available room (RePar), daily sales revenue net (DSRN), occupancy percentage, average daily rate (ADR), and realization are displayed through visually clear cards. A pie chart visually represents revenue distribution by category, while a line chart illustrates trends over time. Furthermore, a table showcases property names along with average ratings, revenue, and city details. This user-friendly dashboard enables effortless exploration and understanding of the hotel business data, supporting effective decision-making.

### Objective
>How have the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) evolved over time and what insights do they provide about the hotel's financial and operational performance?

>How does the Average Daily Rate (ADR) vary across different booking platforms, and how does it relate to the Realization percentage for a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation strategies?

>What is the revenue distribution among different categories, and how does this insight contribute to identifying the most profitable areas of the hotel business?

>How does the weekly revenue trend differ across various categories, and what patterns emerge when analyzing the revenue dynamics over different weeks?
