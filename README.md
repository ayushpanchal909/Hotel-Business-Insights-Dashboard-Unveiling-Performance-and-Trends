## Hotel-management-Analysis-Report
In my Business Intelligence project, I imported and organized raw data tables including information about hotels, rooms, aggregated bookings, and booking details. After cleaning the data and creating essential DAX measures and calculated columns, I designed a dashboard with user-friendly features. This dashboard allows users to filter data based on city and room class, with additional slicers for months, weeks, and years. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, revenue per available room (RePar), daily sales revenue net (DSRN), occupancy percentage, average daily rate (ADR), and realization are displayed through visually clear cards. A pie chart visually represents revenue distribution by category, while a line chart illustrates trends over time. Furthermore, a table showcases property names along with average ratings, revenue, and city details. This user-friendly dashboard enables effortless exploration and understanding of the hotel business data, supporting effective decision-making.
